Previously I blogged about how to build a simple <a  title="Grid computing" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grid_computing" rel="wikipedia">grid computing</a> framework using <a  title="Python (programming language)" href="http://www.python.org/" rel="homepage">Python</a> <a  title="Standard library" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_library" rel="wikipedia">standard library</a>. I have recently been working on converting it into a functional library that can be used by anyone very easily. That is now ready and available for you all. I have not enforced any licence at this point and it is generally free, but I would encourage for people to consider donating some amount to help me build the resources required to maintain this as a long term project.
