As part of our daily lives we have at some point in life come across situations where we felt we should better remember and better stick to our monthly budgets - this is by far easier than tracking individual expenses - but this still requires that we remember numbers top of our heads. 

We have recently launched a simple website <a href="http://rememberthebudget.in">http://rememberthebudget.in</a> which let's you enter your monthly income and expense items and helps you track and chart monthly budgets for the year - take a look and let us know what you think and if it made a difference to your life.
