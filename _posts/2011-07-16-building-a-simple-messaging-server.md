Anyone working in a large enterprise IT department has used JMS, MQ or TIBCO RV for messaging. These are proven industry solutions that work well in demanding situations.

But how are these built? It would be good to learn. It should be pretty easy to build a simple version of this using the popular libraries.

Last week, I set about building one such server to learn more. I have documented the whole process and also shared the code online.

Let me know what you think.
