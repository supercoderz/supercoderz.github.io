The title of this post is pretty simple, but the word itself is pretty complicated and carries with itself lot of meaning. This simple word is more complicated than the most complex <a class="zem_slink" title="Technical architecture" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_architecture" rel="wikipedia">technical architecture</a> you would have seen. This is something that can make or break even the best technologist amongst us.

In this post I will discuss my thoughts about this complex and important aspect of work called Leadership.

<h3><strong>Some material</strong></h3>
The following <a class="zem_slink" title="Three Links" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Links" rel="wikipedia">three links</a> to posts by <a class="zem_slink" title="Joel Spolsky" href="http://joel.spolsky.com" rel="homepage">Joel Spolsky</a> are something that I wish I had come across earlier - they verbalize some of my thoughts very effectively.

I am a great believer of the fact that the <a class="zem_slink" title="Ramayana" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramayana" rel="wikipedia">Ramayana</a>, <a class="zem_slink" title="Mahabharata" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahabharata" rel="wikipedia">Mahabharata</a> and all those <a class="zem_slink" title="History of India" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_India" rel="wikipedia">ancient Indian</a> texts that tell tales of dharma do have an application even in this day and age. The following two videos explain two things from this which really mean something to me - the relation between rules and principles, and leadership.

<h3>So what should a leader be like?</h3>
A leader should be
<ul>
	<li>Fearless - someone who is Â afraid of <a class="zem_slink" title="Failure" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failure" rel="wikipedia">failure</a> cannot lead a team to a victory. Constantly enthusing the team to win is good because everyone wants to win but doing so because you are afraid to lose will not help the team but harm it.</li>
	<li>Prepared to fail - yes, if you are not prepared to fail then you cannot win.</li>
	<li>Wanting to win - while you are prepared to fail, you should have the aim to win.</li>
	<li>Open to criticism - a leader should be willing to accept that he is wrong - that way he will earn more respect</li>
	<li>Able to put aside the self and work for the team - it doesn't really make sense if the leader got promoted while the team failed. A leader cannot be successful without his team being successful. A <a class="zem_slink" title="Leadership" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leadership" rel="wikipedia">good leader</a> is one who can put aside his personal goals and helps his team achieve their goals. By helping the team grow, you will achieve your results and there by you will grow.</li>
	<li>A friend - yes a leader should be a friend, one to whom you can always go and ask anything and everything, One who cares for you and your betterment in career.</li>
	<li>Objective and compassionate - yes a leader needs to be objective and call a spade a spade. But by <a class="zem_slink" title="Letter and spirit of the law" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_and_spirit_of_the_law" rel="wikipedia">following the letter</a> of the rules, he should not forget the spirit of the rule. Since we are all people and people have emotions, compassion is necessary. At the same the leader should not let his emotions harm others</li>
</ul>
These are just some qualities that will help a leader be more human and get better results.
<h3>But why are people not like this?</h3>
Why? Look around you - the amount of pressure on us to do well, impress and grow is so high that it becomes impossible to keep in mind the larger picture and think wisely. We all look for the shortest and the easiest approach and that leads to problems.

It is difficult being the only one who is going against the flow when you don't see results or recognition for what you are doing. If we hang on to it for a little while longer then there will be results but in this day of tough competition it is not always possible.

It is not impossible to do this, but only needs some patience and effort from our side.
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
There is no conclusion - we all have to decide for ourselves what kind of leaders we want to be known as.
