Over the last year or so I have reduced the amount of blogs I write. This is partly due to the change in my work and schedules. Since then I found that I am not able to keep up with the moderation of the comments on Wordpress, and I am getting a lot of spam.

I have always wanted to host as much of my content as possible in one place, so I decided to move the blog to a simple jekyll site on github. And here it is today.

Hopefully I will blog more often going forward.
