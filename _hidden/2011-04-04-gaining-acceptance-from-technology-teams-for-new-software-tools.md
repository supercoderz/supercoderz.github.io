If you are working in technology, and have been working for a long time, then you definitely have an arsenal of preferred tools that you would like to use to solve your everyday problems. Depending on what you do this could be a set of <a  title="Programming language" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language" rel="wikipedia">programming languages</a>, vendor products, custom scripts or even plain excel spreadsheets. At the end of the day these tools help you achieve the results that help the business that your IT helps run.

As time goes by, every technology either gets outdated because new versions or better technologies have emerged, or there is a need to radically change the way you run your IT so that the business can so what it does best even better - make more money. So there is always a push from the management to go for better and more efficient technologies.

And here in lies the great clash of the old and new - the old preferring to stay the way they were because it ain't broken and the new trying to prove how shiny they are. Its not wrong from either perspective.


<h3>Reasons for change</h3>
Reasons for change are plenty, for example
<ul>
	<li>The business can save money by moving away from vendor products and building in-house solutions that get the job done</li>
	<li>Consolidate the large number of existing systems and processes into a lean flow and save both on software and human costs</li>
	<li>Less things to manage or worry about and hence less overhead and more productivity</li>
	<li>The technology just does not make sense any more</li>
	<li>The new boss has his own ideas and agendas or has something that worked elsewhere for him which he wants to run here</li>
</ul>
While these are in no particular order, you can find many more very easily.
<h3>Reasons for not willing to change</h3>
Reasons for not changing are equally varied and can vary from
<ul>
	<li>The guy selling the new approach is cocky about his tool being the best and does not really have the experience to understand why the old approach works</li>
	<li>The new tool imposing demands that might not be practical considering the situation on the ground</li>
	<li>There are better ways to do</li>
	<li>The new approach would fail in certain peculiar cases or cases that do not conform to the known use cases</li>
	<li>Ego</li>
	<li>Laziness</li>
</ul>
And yes - you can find many many more
<h3>But changes do happen</h3>
But changes do happen and systems do change. Either the main opposition is shown the door, won over, or some vendor promises to build the whole thing for free in exchange for a support contract, or the old system just plain rolls over and dies one day.

But there are ways that you can sell your new approach without rousing peoples sentiment, no matter how inexperienced or cocky or arrogant you are or how plain stupid it is and you can even get help on how to make it better so that it is even more widely accepted.

So how can we do that? Simple -
<ul>
	<li>Try to empathize with what the people do in the old system and understand that process like the back of your hand. People appreciate people who have been through or at least know the pain they face. Psychology 101.</li>
	<li>Do not ever start out by saying that the existing system or approach or system is bullshit or does not have the right to exist - people put their lives into making or maintaining a system and would not like to see their efforts being rubbished. Instead tell them that there is this new approach that you could consider.</li>
	<li>Do not say that your system is the silver bullet - of course it isn't and even you know that in the back of your mind. Instead show them you can solve a certain problem more efficiently with the new system.</li>
	<li>Do not try to make your system full of the latest technology which was invented by the coolest hacker just yesterday - all software is based on theoretical principles that were founded when we were itches in our dad's pants. Its not rocket science.</li>
	<li>Try explaining in terms of small prototypes which they can see working.</li>
	<li>Try not to rubbish their concerns about the new system, try to address them calmly; Although there will be a few that can be outright trashed.</li>
	<li>Don't rush.</li>
	<li>Be willing to be proved wrong.</li>
	<li>Have data points to quantify the amount of saving or improvement your approach provides - no one can refute data, unless its obviously faked.</li>
</ul>
These are not things that I cooked up over a lazy afternoon - we used many of these. and free beer too, but mainly these. I tried to sell someone that I will build a string based <a  title="XML" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML" rel="wikipedia">XML parser</a> for their problem. That guy laughed at me - OK fine, I told him the issues with his approach, explained mine, built a prototype, compared metrics and that's it - I had the keys to the kingdom and we did it. What was initially a stupid idea shaved 200 milliseconds off of our critical flow in the application.

Its all doable - but its up to you whether you do it the hard way or the nice way.
